### Requirements
#### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files must be executable
- All your files should end with a new line
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

#### Python Unit Tests

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- You have to use the unittest module
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your test files should be inside a folder tests
- All your test files and folders should start by test_
- All your test files should be python files (extension: .py)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m unittest discover tests
- All your modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge cases
- All your classes should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')
- You can also test file by file by using this command: python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for models/base_model.py, unit tests must be in: tests/test_models/test_base_model.py
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')

#### SQL Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files should end with a new line
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All SQL keywords should be in uppercase (SELECT, WHERE…)
- Your files will be executed with SQLAlchemy version 1.2.x
- All your files should start by a comment describing the task
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- All your SQL queries should have a comment just before (i.e. syntax above)
- All your files will be executed on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using MySQL 5.7 (version 5.7.8-rc)
